# Sudoku-Checker-Python-Essentials-2-Lab

Sudoku is a number-placing puzzle played on a 9x9 board. The player has to fill the board in a very specific way:

- each row of the board must contain all digits from 0 to 9 (the order doesn't matter)

- each column of the board must contain all digits from 0 to 9 (again, the order doesn't matter)

- each of the nine 3x3 "tiles" ("sub-squares") of the table must contain all digits from 0 to 9.

The program reads 9 rows of the Sudoku, each containing 9 digits checking if the data entered are valid then outputs Yes if the Sudoku is valid, and No otherwise.
